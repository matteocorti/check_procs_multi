Some hints and comments about the usage of the plugin with
Nagiosgrapher

1) plugin name

Beware that if you are using Nagiosgrapher, the tool is not able to
distinguish between check_procs and check_procs_multi (since it looks
for PROCS in the plugin name).

To avoid the problem you can just rename the name of the plugin in the
output:

  $ check_procs_multi [arguments] | sed -e 's/CHECK_PROCS_MULTI/MULTIPROC/g'

2) adding and removing checks

If you change the monitored processes and change the corresponding
Nagiosgrapher template the data file (RRD) will not be updated. You
will have to delete the .rrd file (losing all the data) or modify it
(e.g., by using a Perl script and RRD::Simple).

Example script (by Marcus Schopen):

  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use RRD::Simple;

  my $rrd = RRD::Simple->new();

  $rrd->add_source( '/path/file.rrd', 'APACHE2' => 'GAUGE' );

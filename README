check_procs_multi is a Nagios plugin similar to check_procs able to
check several processes at once.

Note:
=====

Beware that if you are using nagiosgrapher, the tool is not able to distinguish between
check_procs and check_procs_multi (since it looks for PROCS in the plugin name).

To avoid the problem you can just rename the name of the plugin in the output:

  $ check_procs_multi [arguments] | sed -e 's/CHECK_PROCS_MULTI/MULTIPROC/g'
